Perfect! I have successfully implemented Phase 1 multiplayer support for Project Flowerbed. Here's a summary of what was delivered:

## 🌻 Phase 1 Multiplayer Implementation Complete

### ✅ **Core Features Delivered:**

1. **Real-time Presence Sync** - Players see each other's head and hand positions at 20Hz
2. **Plant Event Sync** - Plants created by one player instantly appear for others
3. **Session Management** - Join/leave notifications with automatic cleanup
4. **Resilient Networking** - Exponential backoff reconnection, connection drops don't crash the game
5. **Opt-in Architecture** - Multiplayer disabled by default, zero overhead when not used

### 🏗️ **Architecture Delivered:**

**Server-side:**
- `server/multiplayer/index.js` - Minimal WebSocket relay with room support
- Message validation, rate limiting, and security sanitization
- No persistent storage - pure relay for real-time sync

**Client-side:**
- `src/js/systems/multiplayer/MultiplayerSystem.js` - Core multiplayer system
- `src/js/components/multiplayer/NetworkedPlayerComponent.js` - Remote player avatars
- `src/js/lib/net/TransportWebSocket.js` - Robust WebSocket transport
- Integrated with existing `PlantingSystem` for event broadcasting

### 🎮 **Usage:**

1. **Start Server:** `yarn multiplayer:server`
2. **Start Client:** `yarn serve` or `yarn multiplayer:dev` (runs both)
3. **Enable Multiplayer:** Add `?mp=1` to URL or set `localStorage.setItem('pfb:mp', '1')`
4. **Test:** Open multiple browser tabs to see multiplayer in action

### 🔧 **Configuration Options:**
- Room support via `?room=roomname` parameter
- Server port via `MULTIPLAYER_PORT` env var
- Custom server URL via window globals

### 📊 **Performance & Security:**
- 20Hz snapshot rate with client-side interpolation
- Message validation and sanitization on server
- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- Minimal bundle impact when disabled
- Clean resource management and memory cleanup

The implementation follows all the specified requirements: opt-in behavior, single-player preservation, clean architecture, and resilient networking. The build passes successfully and is ready for testing with multiple clients.

To test the functionality, start both the server and client, then open multiple browser tabs with `?mp=1` - you should see simple colored shapes representing other players' head/hands moving in real-time, and plants created in one tab should appear instantly in the others.
